It is loaded from parameters, used in search and matching processes for consumption allocation, and influences how household demand is distributed across economic sectors. The context suggests it is a vector (not a matrix) that applies uniformly across households, with different vectors for different household types not explicitly shown.\n\n## 1. What It Is / Purpose\n`b_HH_g` represents the budget share parameters for household consumption across different economic sectors/groups. It determines how household consumption demand is distributed among various sectors of the economy during the search and matching process [12]. The 'g' subscript indicates it is grouped by economic sectors rather than individual households.\n\n## 2. Where It Lives (Paths, Line Spans)\nThe symbol `b_HH_g` appears in multiple files:\n\n- **Definition/Assignment**: In `/Users/mimuw2022/Documents/GitHub/deepseek_rag/data_and_programs/model_scaled/simulate_abm.m` [7]:\n  ```matlab\n  b_HH_g=parameters.b_HH_g;\n  ```\n\n- **Parameter Loading**: In the same file [11]:\n  ```matlab\n  parameters=coder.load('./parameters/2010Q1.mat','G','H_act','H_inact',...,'b_HH_g',...);\n  ```\n\n- **Usage**: In `/Users/mimuw2022/Documents/GitHub/deepseek_rag/data_and_programs/model_scaled/search_and_matching.m` [12]:\n  ```matlab\n  function [Q_d_i,...,C_l]=search_and_matching(...,b_HH_g,...)\n  ```\n\n- **Function Interface**: In `/Users/mimuw2022/Documents/GitHub/deepseek_rag/data_and_programs/model_scaled/abmx.m` [9]:\n  ```matlab\n  function [nominal_gdp,...,L_i]=abmx(...,b_HH_g,...)\n  ```\n\n## 3. API/Contracts: Inputs, Outputs, Side Effects\n**Input**: `b_HH_g` is passed as a parameter to functions:\n- `abmx()` function signature shows it receives `b_HH_g` as input [9]\n- `search_and_matching()` function also receives `b_HH_g` as input [12]\n\n**Output**: The symbol itself is not modified or returned as output; it serves as a configuration parameter.\n\n**Side Effects**: No direct side effects. It influences consumption allocation patterns indirectly through the search and matching algorithm.\n\n## 4. How It Is Used (Call Sites)\nThe primary usage is in the search and matching process for consumption allocation [12]:\n```matlab\nfunction [Q_d_i,Q_d_m,P_bar_i,DM_i,P_CF_i,I_i,P_bar_h,C_h,P_bar_CF_h,I_h,P_j,C_j,P_l,C_l]=search_and_matching(P_i,Y_i,S_i,S_i_,G_i,P_m,Y_m,a_sg,DM_d_i,b_CF_g,I_d_i,b_HH_g,C_d_h,b_CFH_g,I_d_h,c_G_g,C_d_j,c_E_g,C_d_l)\n```\n\nHere, `b_HH_g` works alongside `C_d_h` (household consumption demand) to determine how consumption is allocated across different economic sectors.\n\n## 5. Edge Cases & Risks\n- **Dimensionality Risk**: The code assumes `b_HH_g` has dimensions matching the number of sectors (G), as indicated by `G=size(b_HH_g,1)` [12]\n- **Normalization Risk**: The values should likely sum to 1 across sectors for proper budget share representation\n- **Zero Demand Risk**: If `C_d_h` is zero, the budget shares become irrelevant\n- **Sector Mismatch**: Requires consistent grouping with `G_i` sector assignments\n\n## 6. Related Symbols\n- `b_CF_g`: Budget shares for capital formation by sector [7, 9, 12]\n- `b_CFH_g`: Budget shares for household capital formation [7, 9, 12]  \n- `C_d_h`: Household consumption demand [12]\n- `G_i`: Sector grouping for individual entities [2, 12]\n- `a_sg`: Technical coefficients matrix [7, 9, 12]\n\n## 7. Matrix vs Vector for Different Households\nBased on the context, **`b_HH_g` appears to be a vector, not a matrix**, and **the current implementation does not support different vectors for different household types**. Evidence:\n\n1. The loading statement shows `b_HH_g` as a simple parameter [7, 11]\n2. The function signature in `search_and_matching` accepts a single `b_HH_g` parameter [12]\n3. The dimensionality check `G=size(b_HH_g,1)` [12] suggests it's a vector with G elements (number of sectors)\n4. No evidence of household-specific indexing or multiple `b_HH` vectors in the context\n\nThe current architecture uses a single consumption budget share vector that applies uniformly to all households, with differentiation likely happening through other mechanisms like income levels or `C_d_h` values.\n\n## 8. Step-by-Step Trace\n1. **Parameter Loading**: `b_HH_g` is loaded from parameter files during initialization [11]\n2. **Assignment**: Assigned from parameters structure in main simulation [7]\n3. **Propagation**: Passed to the `abmx()` function [9]  \n4. **Delegation**: Further passed to `search_and_matching()` function [12]\n5. **Usage**: Used within search algorithm to allocate household consumption across sectors\n6. **Consumption Calculation**: Influences the final `C_h` (actual household consumption) values\n\n## 9. Next Investigation Steps\nTo fully understand household differentiation:\n1. Examine the structure of `C_d_h` to see if it contains household-specific data\n2. Investigate how `H_act` and `H_inact` parameters differentiate household types\n3. Check if other parameters (like income or wealth variables) provide household differentiation\n4. Look for household-specific budget share implementations in other versions or modules\n5. Examine how the search algorithm handles multiple households with a single budget vector\n\nThe current implementation suggests a homogeneous consumption pattern across households, with differentiation likely coming from demand levels (`C_d_h`) rather than budget share patterns.", "sources": [{"id": 1, "source": "/Users/mimuw2022/Documents/GitHub/deepseek_rag/data_and_programs/model_scaled/simulate_abm.m", "line": null, "span": null}, {"id": 2, "source": "/Users/mimuw2022/Documents/GitHub/deepseek_rag/data_and_programs/model_scaled/simulate_abm.m", "line": null, "span": null}, {"id": 3, "source": "/Users/mimuw2022/Documents/GitHub/deepseek_rag/data_and_programs/model_scaled/abmx.m", "line": null, "span": null}, {"id": 4, "source": "/Users/mimuw2022/Documents/GitHub/deepseek_rag/data_and_programs/model_scaled/simulate_abm.m", "line": null, "span": null}, {"id": 5, "source": "/Users/mimuw2022/Documents/GitHub/deepseek_rag/data_and_programs/model_scaled/search_and_matching.m", "line": null, "span": null}, {"id": 6, "source": "/Users/mimuw2022/Documents/GitHub/deepseek_rag/data_and_programs/model_scaled/abm.m", "line": null, "span": null}, {"id": 7, "source": "/Users/mimuw2022/Documents/GitHub/deepseek_rag/data_and_programs/model_scaled/simulate_abm.m", "line": null, "span": null}, {"id": 8, "source": "/Users/mimuw2022/Documents/GitHub/deepseek_rag/data_and_programs/model_scaled/epsilon.m", "line": null, "span": null}, {"id": 9, "source": "/Users/mimuw2022/Documents/GitHub/deepseek_rag/data_and_programs/model_scaled/abmx.m", "line": null, "span": null}, {"id": 10, "source": "/Users/mimuw2022/Documents/GitHub/deepseek_rag/data_and_programs/model_scaled/import_abmx.m", "line": null, "span": null}, {"id": 11, "source": "/Users/mimuw2022/Documents/GitHub/deepseek_rag/data_and_programs/model_scaled/simulate_abm.m", "line": null, "span": null}, {"id": 12, "source": "/Users/mimuw2022/Documents/GitHub/deepseek_rag/data_and_programs/model_scaled/search_and_matching.m", "line": null, "span": null}], "k": 12, "max_context_chars": 120000, "status": "ok"}
